# How To Reverse Updates on Fedora

If Fedora updates, breaking your system, you can revert using the `yum history` command. Find the `Transaction ID` of the update to reverse, then use `sudo yum history undo <Transaction ID>` to reverse it.

~~~
# show list of updates
sudo yum history list

# show info about a specific update
sudo yum history info <transaction id>

# undo/reverse an update
sudo yum history undo <transaction id>
